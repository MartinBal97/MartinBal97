# Hi, I’m Martín

Front-end developer focused on **mobile and web applications**, with 3+ years of experience building and maintaining production-ready products.

I work mainly with **Flutter** for mobile and **modern web technologies** (React, TypeScript, JavaScript). My priorities are **clean architecture, maintainable code, and usability**. I care about performance, readability, and making things easy to reason about for whoever touches the code next.

I’m not interested in trends for the sake of trends. I value tools that solve real problems and teams that take engineering seriously.

Feel free to explore the repositories.
